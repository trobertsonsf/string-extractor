Unless you work on my team at Spredfast, you won't care about this tool.  The code is a big hack and has a bunch of strings / patterns sprecific to our app that we want to include/exclude

This tool uses babylon and walk-tree to parse a react based app file and help display strings to be externalized. 

Usage

	 node index.js /Users/trobertson/gits/agent-inbox/client/scripts/src/components/dashboard/InProgressReport.js
